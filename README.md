Student and Aspiring Full Stack Developer
-----------------------------------------

🎓 I'm a student with a strong passion for technology and software development, currently diving deep into the world of Full Stack Development. I enjoy building projects that connect the front-end and back-end seamlessly, and I’m constantly exploring new technologies to expand my skillset.

💻 So far, I've been working with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React on the front-end, while learning Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and SQL for the back-end. I'm also gaining experience with Git/GitHub for version control and collaboration.

🚀 I'm always working on personal projects and coursework to strengthen my understanding of web development, and I aim to contribute to open-source projects in the near future. My goal is to become a well-rounded Full Stack Developer who can build scalable, efficient, and user-friendly applications.

📚 I believe in continuous learning and am currently focusing on sharpening my skills in API development, authentication systems, and responsive design. I’m excited about what the future holds and the opportunities to grow as a developer.

Let’s connect, collaborate, and build something awesome together!
